    My name is Viktor Niedens. I first started coding in 2014 and never stopped since. 
    In 2019 I got in contact with web development and decided to specialize in that field.
    Since 2021 I am working at <a href="https://www.treubrodt-consulting.de/">Treubrodt Consulting</a> as 
    a fullstack developer. I enjoy coding and always seek to improve the user experience of the software that I write
    as well as the developer experience by increasing readability of the code and the file structure.
    At the not so distant future I see myself working in encouraging as well as challenging projects to
    further extend my skillset. Be it as a freelancer or at a company.
